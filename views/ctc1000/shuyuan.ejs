		    	<p class="project_description"><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/zhengsy1997/present/rBumLzGi2">ReRead</a> is a project inspired by David Jhave Johnston’s works and the book, ReRites: Human + A.I. Poetry produced and collected by him. The book is a collection of poems generated by A.I. and edited, organized by humans. In my project, I attempted to have the machine analyze the text from the book, deconstruct them and label them, and have the result returned to us as readers. Human audiences will then read them again, perceive them along with the instruction given. Throughout this process, I created an unfamiliar context for poetry to exist, with the absence of either human authorship or agency of perceivers. By deconstructing the components of poetry, I want to clarify the role that has been played by human consciousness in the process of creating poetics and possibly explore the essence of poetics.</p>

		    	<p class="project_description">Catch Me If You Can (CMIYC) is an application that aims to raise users’ awareness of cyber-surveillance by giving the computer agency and facilitating interaction between users and their devices.</p>
		    	
		    	<p class="project_description">The app will activate your web camera once it is opened, and just like a cyber-surveillance, it will constantly observe those pixels in its vision. When the application is activated and the user’s body movements are detected, it will shut down the computer. To fight for the right to use the computer, the user will have to be strategic about their body movements. Move slowly to fail the motion detection, or take a detour and approach it as sneakily as a lion approaching its target.</p>
